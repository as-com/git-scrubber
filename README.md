git-scrubber
===

This is a tool to create a parallel Git repository with matching commit history and 
redacted file data. It can also redact commit authors and timestamps.

It is intended to be used to populate a GitHub contributions chart without needing to 
share commit data with GitHub. 

Example: https://github.com/as-com/linux-redacted (Linux kernel with redacted file data and users)
